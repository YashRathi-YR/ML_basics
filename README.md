# ML_basics
Welcome to my personal repository where I've been practicing fundamental machine learning techniques. These  files contain implementations of various algorithms that I've learned. They are implemented in a simple and easy-to-understand manner, reflecting my learning journey in machine learning.Feel free to explore and learn alongside me! If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out.
